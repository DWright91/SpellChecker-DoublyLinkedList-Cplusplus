Summary:
This program uses two classes in order of attaining the doubly linked list, basically your standard linked list except in order for it to be a doubly linked list
you need each node to have two pointers one for the next and one for the previous node. The list starts at a head pointer then the next pointer is null more-over 
the last pointer is also null in the linked list, this makes it possible to traverse the list automatically between the null pointers. Part 2, the program reads 
words from a file into a container then uses function to check correct spelling of the words based on a given in-file dictionary and displays the words that are 
incorrect based on the spelling within the dictionary file.

Try to add another entry: add("extra") returns 1
contains("three"): returns 1; should be 1 (true)
contains("ten"): returns 0; should be 0 (false)
getFrequencyOf("one"): returns 2 should be 2
remove("one"): returns 1; should be 1 (true)
getFrequencyOf("one"): returns 1 should be 1
remove("one"): returns 1; should be 1 (true)
remove("one"): returns 0; should be 0 (false)

The bag contains 5 items:
extra five four three two 

After clearing the bag, isEmpty: returns 1; should be 1 (true)
All done!
